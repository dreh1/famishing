# Famishing
a Hunger Games simulator/engine written in Python
========

github told me to include this, so ta-da.
Building this from the ground up. Features expected at the end are players customization, a dice-based quick combat system, inventories and of course, a GUI. Eventually, I strive to make the game as moddable as posible with parsers and stuff, but don't expect everything to be decoupled from the start.
Does someone even read these? smh tbh fam
